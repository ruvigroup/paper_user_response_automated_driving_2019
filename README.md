Authors: Alberto Morando, Trent Victor, Klaus Bengler, and Marco Dozza

The pre-print (pre-refereeing) of the paper is available at https://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.18560.89603/1.

This repository contains:
- The video of the simulated scenario (bird-eye view).
- Trajectories of the subject vehicle (and principal other vehicles) for each participant and critical event.
- Tables (as comma separated values files) of the response time and type for each participant and critical event. Note that the type of critical events are coded, for brevity, as follow `A: Rear-end`, `B: Sideswipe`, `C: False warning`.
